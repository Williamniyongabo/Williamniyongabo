           <h3>Steph’s Dedication to his Faith </h3>
      <p>Curry has been outspoken about his Christian faith. He spoke about his faith during his MVP speech by saying,
	  "People should know who I represent and why I am who I am, and that's because of my Lord and Savior."
	  He also said the reason that he pounds his chest and points up is that he has a "heart for God" and as a reminder that he plays for God.[204]
	  On some of his "Curry One" basketball shoes, there is a lace loop scripted "4:13". It is a reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13, which reads
	  "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." Curry has a tattoo of First Corinthians 13:8 in Hebrew on his wrist ("Love never fails...").
